As part of the internal audit for Botium Toys, I reviewed the scope, goals, and risk assessment report provided by the IT manager. This report highlights the challenges associated with their expanding online presence and the need to secure critical assets while ensuring compliance with regulations like PCI DSS and GDPR. The goal of this audit is to evaluate their current security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend actionable steps to address risks.

Risk Assessment: Botium Toys faces growing risks related to the storage and processing of sensitive customer data, both locally and internationally. I identified the following areas of concern based on the control categories and compliance best practices outlined in the NIST CSF:

Customer Data Protection: With Botium processing payments online and expanding into the European market, compliance with GDPR is crucial. I recommend implementing encryption for sensitive data and reviewing access control mechanisms to limit exposure of personal information.

Regulatory Compliance: While PCI DSS compliance for handling online payments is partially addressed, gaps exist in ensuring adherence to GDPR standards, such as data minimization and consent management. Improving internal processes for these areas is critical.

Employee Security Practices: Employees lack regular cybersecurity training. This presents a risk of accidental vulnerabilities due to phishing or other social engineering tactics. Developing a structured training program will reduce human error risks.

Controls Checklist: I systematically reviewed the NIST CSF control categories:

Identify: Asset management processes are in place, but formal documentation of critical assets is incomplete.
Protect: Physical security controls for the main office are adequate, but online systems require stronger encryption and multifactor authentication.
Detect: Current detection capabilities are limited to basic logging. Enhancing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and log analysis tools is essential.
Respond and Recover: There is no formal incident response plan, and backup protocols need to be tested regularly.
For each control listed in the checklist, I selected either “yes” or “no” to indicate the current implementation status. This structured approach clarified existing gaps and provided a clear roadmap for addressing priorities.

Compliance Best Practices: I also reviewed compliance best practices, selecting “yes” or “no” for each to evaluate Botium’s adherence to industry standards and regulatory requirements. This assessment highlighted areas needing improvement, particularly in aligning with GDPR and PCI DSS, and underscored the importance of implementing robust consent mechanisms for E.U. customers.

Recommendations: Based on this review, I propose the following:

Enhance Encryption and Access Controls: Protect customer data through end-to-end encryption and role-based access.
Establish Incident Response Procedures: Develop and test a formal incident response plan to handle breaches effectively.
Implement Cybersecurity Awareness Training: Educate employees on emerging threats to reduce risk exposure.
Strengthen Regulatory Compliance: Invest in tools and processes to align fully with PCI DSS and GDPR requirements.
By focusing on these areas, Botium Toys can secure its infrastructure, protect its customers, and continue to grow confidently in the global market.
