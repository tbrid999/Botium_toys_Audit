As part of the internal audit for Botium Toys, I began by thoroughly reviewing the scope, goals, and risk assessment report provided by the IT manager. This initial review set the foundation for understanding the company’s current security posture and the areas requiring immediate attention. The scope of this audit focuses on evaluating the company’s IT infrastructure, ensuring compliance with regulations such as PCI DSS and GDPR, and identifying vulnerabilities that could impact critical assets. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to address these vulnerabilities, secure customer data, and prepare Botium Toys for future growth in the online marketplace.

Scope and Goals Review:
To ensure a structured approach, I referred to the controls and compliance checklist, which outlines key areas to be addressed during the audit. The checklist guided the evaluation of the following:

Assets: I assessed whether the company had a clear inventory of critical assets, including hardware, software, and sensitive data, and found that formal documentation is lacking.
Threats: I evaluated potential threats to both the physical and digital infrastructure, particularly the risks posed by unauthorized access to customer data and payment systems.
Risks: The risk assessment highlighted significant gaps in both compliance and security controls, which could lead to financial penalties and reputational damage.
Compliance: The review emphasized the need to adhere to regulations, particularly GDPR for international customers and PCI DSS for payment security.
By addressing each item in the checklist, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Botium Toys’ security needs and priorities.

Controls Checklist:
Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I systematically reviewed each control category, selecting “yes” or “no” based on its current implementation status at Botium Toys. Below is a summary of the findings:

Identify: No
Asset management processes are partially implemented, but formal documentation of critical assets is incomplete. Without a clear inventory, it’s challenging to prioritize resources and implement effective protections.

Protect: No
Physical security controls are sufficient for the main office, but online systems lack essential safeguards like multifactor authentication and encryption for sensitive customer and payment data. This creates a high-risk environment for potential breaches.

Detect: No
Current detection capabilities are minimal, with basic logging in place but no tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS). This limits the company’s ability to monitor and identify real-time threats effectively.

Respond and Recover: No
There is no formal incident response plan, and backup protocols are not tested regularly. This lack of preparation poses a significant risk to the company’s ability to recover from a security incident quickly and effectively.

Compliance Best Practices:
In addition to controls, I evaluated Botium’s compliance with industry best practices, selecting “yes” or “no” for each. The results are as follows:

PCI DSS Compliance: No
While Botium processes online payments, it has not fully implemented the controls necessary to meet PCI DSS standards. For instance, sensitive payment data is not encrypted end-to-end, and there is no comprehensive access control for payment systems.

GDPR Compliance: No
As Botium expands into the European market, GDPR compliance is critical. However, there are significant gaps in areas such as consent management, data minimization, and ensuring customer rights like data deletion. Addressing these gaps is crucial to avoid regulatory fines.

General Compliance Awareness: No
Policies and procedures are not well-documented, and there is no formal training program to ensure employees understand compliance requirements. This lack of awareness could result in accidental non-compliance.

Risk Assessment:
The risk assessment provided valuable insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities. Key findings include:

Data Protection Risks: The lack of encryption and access controls exposes sensitive customer information to potential breaches.
Regulatory Risks: Failure to comply with GDPR and PCI DSS could result in significant fines and reputational damage, particularly as the company expands internationally.
Operational Risks: Without a formal incident response plan, the company is unprepared for security incidents, which could lead to prolonged downtime and financial losses.
Recommendations:
To address these risks and improve Botium Toys’ security posture, I propose the following actions:

Develop a Comprehensive Asset Inventory: Document all critical assets, including hardware, software, and data, to provide a clear understanding of what needs protection.
Enhance Security Controls: Implement encryption for sensitive data, multifactor authentication for all online systems, and role-based access controls.
Invest in Detection Tools: Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) and centralized log analysis to identify and respond to threats in real time.
Establish an Incident Response Plan: Develop and test a formal incident response plan to ensure quick and effective recovery from potential breaches.
Ensure Regulatory Compliance: Adopt tools and processes to meet PCI DSS and GDPR requirements, focusing on encrypted payment data and robust consent management.
Provide Employee Training: Implement regular cybersecurity training to increase compliance awareness and reduce risks associated with human error.

Final Remarks:
Through this audit, I identified critical gaps in Botium Toys’ security posture and compliance practices. By addressing these issues, the company can strengthen its defenses, protect customer data, and confidently expand its online presence. The scope and goals review, along with the structured evaluation of controls and compliance best practices, provides a clear roadmap for improvement. Implementing the recommendations outlined here will enable Botium Toys to achieve a robust, scalable security framework aligned with its business objectives.
